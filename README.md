Navigation library for simple and efficient compose navigation. 
At the moment this readme is only here so that I can say that there *technically* is a readme.

# kruiser-sample

The sample requires an unsplash key to show pretty pictures, you can add it by 
1. creating a file in the kruiser root directory called `local.properties`
1. adding `UNSPLASH_KEY=(your key here)` to that file
